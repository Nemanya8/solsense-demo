# SolSense

SolSense is a lightweight, wallet-aware advertising SDK designed to help small Solana dApps generate sustainable revenue by displaying on-chain personalized ads.

## Overview

Solana’s ecosystem is full of small, creative, and community-appreciated dApps — but most of them have no viable way to sustain themselves.

SolSense solves this by enabling any dApp to display banner ads tailored to a user’s on-chain behavior. The goal is to support underfunded but essential projects by giving them a simple, non-intrusive monetization tool that respects the values of Web3.

## How It Works

- **User connects their wallet**
- **dApp passes the wallet address to SolSense SDK**
- **Backend profiles the wallet**: Analyzes DeFi activity, NFT holdings, token interactions, and more
- **SolSense matches and returns a relevant ad**
- **dApp displays a clean banner ad within the UI**

### Key Features

- One-line integration for Solana dApps  
- Profile-based ad targeting (DeFi users, NFT collectors, whales, etc.)  
- Lightweight, responsive banner ad component  
- Advertiser dashboard for campaign creation and tracking  
- Respectful, user-friendly ad experience  

## Hackathon Demo

To showcase SolSense, we are building a demo dApp where users:

- Connect their Solana wallet  
- Get a short personality profile based on their on-chain activity  
- Receive a humorous comment generated by an LLM  
- See a banner ad matched to their profile  
- Can share the result on social media (which also helps us collect engagement data)  

## Why SolSense?

- **Supports small Solana dApps** with a plug-and-play monetization stream  
- **No tokens or paywalls required** – just useful, contextual ad placements  
- **Respects the Web3 experience** with wallet-aware, non-invasive design  
- **Unlocks precise targeting** for advertisers looking to reach real Web3 users  

## Deliverables

- MVP of SolSense SDK (profiling + banner ad rendering)  
- Fully functional demo dApp  
- Advertiser dashboard prototype  
- Social sharing integration  
- Initial dataset from demo usage  

## SDK Integration Example

```ts
import { getAdForWallet } from "@solsense/sdk";

const walletAddress = "user_wallet_here";

const ad = await getAdForWallet(walletAddress);

// Render <AdBanner ad={ad} />
```
## Future Plans

- Deploy SolSense SDK to npm
- Expand wallet profiling with more on-chain signals
- Allow dApps to customize ad styling
- Develop campaign analytics and budget controls for advertisers
- Launch pilot campaigns with ecosystem partners
